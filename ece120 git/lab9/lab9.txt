QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab9.bin.)

ANSWER: I expect the program to modify R2, by clearing it, adding 12 to R2, and storing 12 in R2.


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: The ability to step through a program is a very useful tool for debugging a program because there are so many lines of code in a program, and it is very easy to mistype something and miss the bug when scanning over the code. Stepping through a program goes line by line and ensures that each line is working properly.
